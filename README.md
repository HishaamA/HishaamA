- 👋 Hi, I’m @aspireflight
- The name AspireFlight is taken from two words together. The word ASPIRE meaning to rise towards an object or to have a great Goal in mind, and FLIGHT which represents   DEPARTURE for an Object Sent Into Outer-Space. Thus basically the meaning of the word ASPIRATION is to have a great goal in mind, work hard for it and fly up towards     it.
